I live outside your gates,  
exposed to the rain, exposed to the sun;  
sometimes I’ll cradle my right ear  
in my right palm;  
then when I speak my voice sounds strange,  
alien ...

I'm unsure whose voice I’m hearing:  
mine or yours.  
I implore a trifle;  
the poets cry for more.

Sometimes I cover both eyes  
and my face disappears;  
there it lies heavy in my hands  
looking peaceful, instead,  
so that no one would ever think  
I have no place to lay my head.

Translator's note: I believe the last line may be a reference to a statement made by Jesus Christ in the gospels: that foxes have their dens, but he had no place to lay his head. Rilke may also have had in mind Jesus saying that what someone does "to the least of these" they would also be doing to him.
