This is out of our reach  
This is out of our reach  
This is out of our reach and it's grown  
This is getting to be  
This is getting to be  
This is getting to be drone  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep and I'am

Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
This is out of our range  
This is out of our range  
This is out of our range and it's crude  
This is getting to be  
This is getting to be  
This is getting to be like drone  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep  
I'm a negative creep and I'am

Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more

Yeah!

Drone!

Stoned!

Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more  
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
