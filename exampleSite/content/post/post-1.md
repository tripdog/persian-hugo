When we were young, she was really an attractive girl. But there was something different about her for sure. She got a lot of attention from men. That made her feel wanted and special, but little did she know that nobody's intentions were good.

Over the years, she drifted from one relationship to another. Still, people selfishly took from her, not knowing what damage they were contributing to her situation.

Years continued to click by, and everyone could see a growing sadness in her eyes even when she played it off with a smile. We saw moving toward that door but nothing any of us could do helped her. In fact, it seemed as though the more anyone tried to help her, the closer she got to walking out that door.

Wreckage. Baggage. Sadness. It kept mounting. It was a long line of selfish scumbags that gave her the "tools" to cope with the disappointments of life, the stress and the anxiety that comes with not quite living up to one's own expectations. Never mind living up to the expectations of others.

We all saw it coming but when it actually happens, the shock still hits you like a freight train. We woke up on a rainy day in January, and she'd left us the night before. Just like that, she's gone. We'll never see eachother again. Not in this life. It's so sad. All of those useless users who took from her are still alive, probably taking from someone else.
