When we were young, she was really an attractive girl. But there was something different about her for sure. She got a lot of attention from men, that, made her feel wanted and special, but little did she know that nobody's intentions were good. 

Over the years, she drifted from one relationship to another. Still, people selfishly took from her, not knowing what damage they were contributing to her situation. 

Years continued to click by, and everyone could see a growing sadness in her eyes even when she played it off with a smile. We saw moving toward that door but nothing any of us could do helped her. In fact, it seemed as though the more anyone tried to help her, the closer she got to walking out that door.
