This is an experimental \[HUGO\]([https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo")) build. The design is derived on a theme by ThemeFisher called \[Persian\]([https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/persian-hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/persian-hugo "Persian")). I changed a few things and rebranded it as Ponder. 

Maintenance happens through a headless CMS by <a href="[https://forestry.io/](https://forestry.io/ "https://forestry.io/")">forestry.io.</a> All of the content pages are Markdown files and the code is hosted in my <a href="[https://github.com/tripdog/](https://github.com/tripdog/ "https://github.com/tripdog/")">https://github.com/tripdog/</a> repo. When commits are made, a rebuild happens and the blog is refreshed via GitHub.

All images are from Unsplash and the whole thing is deployed on <a href="[https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/ "https://www.netlify.com/")">Netlify.</a>
