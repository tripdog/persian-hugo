This is an experimental <a href="[https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/ "https://gohugo.io/")">HUGO</a> build. The design is derived on a theme by ThemeFisher called <a href="[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/persian-hugo/](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/persian-hugo/ "https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/persian-hugo/")">Persian.</a> I changed a few things and rebranded it as Ponder. 

Maintenance happens through a headless CMS by <a href="[https://forestry.io/](https://forestry.io/ "https://forestry.io/")">forestry.io.</a> All of the content pages are Markdown files and the code is hosted in my GitHub repo. When commits are made, a rebuild happens and the blog is refreshed via GitHub.

All images are from Unsplash and the whole thing is deployed on Netlify.
